    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today at work I got a task from a client regarding Email Obfuscation. Obviously
we all come across scenarios where we need to better secure our sites for our
clients. But what about emails? It is common for a random bot to eventually
crawl to our sites and pull all
<code>&lt;a href="mailto:someemail@somedomain.com"&gt;someemail@somedomain.com&lt;/a&gt;</code> tags
from our code and then add the emails to some job queue to spam the f*** out of
us.</p>

<p>Granted, it is important we prevent spam, but to what extent shall we do it? I
was suggested the article <a href="http://techblog.tilllate.com/2008/07/20/ten-methods-to-obfuscate-e-mail-addresses-compared/">Nine ways to obfuscate e-mail addresses compared</a> (Pardon the article title, there&rsquo;s only three options I see on the page,
unless I missed something). The website offers three solutions that may solve
our problem. The stats of the graph speak for themselves, but Google searches
suggest many other solutions to the problem as well. Are all the methods 100%
full-proof&mdash;-nope.</p>

<p>One could go crazy trying to find or figure out the absolute best way to
obfuscate our emails. Many of the solutions will stop most bots; however, as
technology improves, the more &ldquo;smart&rdquo; spam bots become. Why do people have to
ruin everything for everyone else? I don&rsquo;t know, and neither will any of us.
The reality is, it doesn&rsquo;t matter what we do.</p>

<p>Let us think for a moment. We can stop the vast majority of bots, but, we can&rsquo;t
stop all of them without destroying a users' experience&mdash;and even then we&rsquo;re
not protected. The reality is, if a spammer <em>really</em> wanted to target your site,
they can.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the saying before:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t a programmer I would be a writer.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<!-- more -->


<p>That statement would be true. Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve felt a strong desire
to start blogging and writing about my experiences as a young web-developer.</p>

<p>But then I began to think&hellip; I recall that it wasn&rsquo;t more than a year ago where
I still wanted to be a educator with a discipline in Latin. Would that still make
me a writer if I wasn&rsquo;t a programmer? Possibly. I suppose that every programmer
would be a writer if they weren&rsquo;t programming. Google searches suggest that most
programmers are also writers in their spare time. I&rsquo;ll just answer my own
statement and say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with confidence.</p>

for close to three years. I have worked very closely with JavaScript, jQuery,
PHP, SQL, and HTML/CSS.</p>

<h2>Why not Wordpress?</h2>

<p>I decided to use Octopress and Git as my source of blogging software because, as
a developer I need not concern myself with the style or hassle of making a style
for my own personal blog. I want my blog to focus on personal questions,
stories, and you guessed it&mdash;code!</p>

<p>Another benefit to a software such as Git and Octopress, I don&rsquo;t need to sit
around and find decent syntax highlighting tools. I can just simple put my code
into here.</p>

<h2>Intentions</h2>

<p>I do not expect many people to visit my blog, and I also do not care if many
people do. I am using this blog as a means to get out questions, observations,
documentation, and code.</p>
