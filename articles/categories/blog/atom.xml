    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I am Frederick Lawler and I make websites. I have worked at the company 40Digits
for close to three years. I have worked very closely with JavaScript, jQuery,
PHP, SQL, and HTML/CSS.</p>

<h2>Why not Wordpress?</h2>

<p>I decided to use Octopress and Git as my source of blogging software because, as
a developer I need not concern myself with the style or hassle of making a style
for my own personal blog. I want my blog to focus on personal questions,
stories, and you guessed it&mdash;code!</p>

<p>Another benefit to a software such as Git and Octopress, I don&rsquo;t need to sit
around and find decent syntax highlighting tools. I can just simple put my code
into here.</p>

<h2>Intentions</h2>

<p>I do not expect many people to visit my blog, and I also do not care if many
people do. I am using this blog as a means to get out questions, observations,
documentation, and code.</p>
