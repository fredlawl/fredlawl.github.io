    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve heard the saying before:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t a programmer I would be a writer.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>That statement would be true. Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve felt a strong desire
to start blogging and writing about my experiences as a young web-developer.</p>

<p>But then I began to think&hellip; I recall that it wasn&rsquo;t more than a year ago where
I still wanted to be a educator with a discipline in Latin. Would that still make
me a writer if I wasn&rsquo;t a programmer? Possibly. I suppose that every programmer
would be a writer if they weren&rsquo;t programming. Google searches suggest that most
programmers are also writers in their spare time. I&rsquo;ll just answer my own
statement and say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with confidence.</p>

for close to three years. I have worked very closely with JavaScript, jQuery,
PHP, SQL, and HTML/CSS.</p>

<h2>Why not Wordpress?</h2>

<p>I decided to use Octopress and Git as my source of blogging software because, as
a developer I need not concern myself with the style or hassle of making a style
for my own personal blog. I want my blog to focus on personal questions,
stories, and you guessed it&mdash;code!</p>

<p>Another benefit to a software such as Git and Octopress, I don&rsquo;t need to sit
around and find decent syntax highlighting tools. I can just simple put my code
into here.</p>

<h2>Intentions</h2>

<p>I do not expect many people to visit my blog, and I also do not care if many
people do. I am using this blog as a means to get out questions, observations,
documentation, and code.</p>
