<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If I wasn&rsquo;t a programmer I would be a writer.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>That statement would be true. Over the past few months I&rsquo;ve felt a strong desire
to start blogging and writing about my experiences as a young web-developer.</p>

<p>But then I began to think&hellip; I recall that it wasn&rsquo;t more than a year ago where
I still wanted to be a educator with a discipline in Latin. Would that still make
me a writer if I wasn&rsquo;t a programmer? Possibly. I suppose that every programmer
would be a writer if they weren&rsquo;t programming. Google searches suggest that most
programmers are also writers in their spare time. I&rsquo;ll just answer my own
statement and say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with confidence.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I had the pleasure of writing my first mobile app. Without a background
or any general knowledge of Objective-C, I had to use my skills as a JavaScript
programmer to bridge the two together using a Open Sourced framework called <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Cordova</a>.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h2>Overview of Cordova</h2>

<p>Cordova is a mobile app framework with an emphasis on cross-compability of all
major mobile devices in the market. With a few vendor plugins, most of
functionality that you would expect from app can be easily installed and put to
use. Cordova also has extensive documentation that clearly outlines its usage
and configuration. The documentation also includes notes on creating custom
plugins if you can&rsquo;t find any others on git that meet your criteria.</p>

<h3>Some links to get started:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.2.0/index.html">Corodva Docs</a> for full documentation.</li>
<li><a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.2.0/guide_cli_index.md.html#The%20Command-Line%20Interface">Cordova CLI</a> for getting started with cordova.</li>
<li><a href="http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.2.0/_index.html">Cordova Index</a> for documentation index.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Solutions to Problems</h2>

<p>Working with Cordova was fairly simple and straight forward. The documentation
allowed me to create an app from start to finish with minimal headaches. Through
the development process there were some obstacles to overcome in a short period
of time.</p>

<p>An obstacle that was particularly hard to adjust to was the fact that the
project called for a mobile-site version, and a app version of the app.
Overcoming that obstacle was a challenge because links could not be treated in
the same manner. When compiled, the app relies on its internal file system to
load pages&mdash;where as a website would rely on its domain. The solution to this
problem was simple&mdash;routing system.</p>

<p>The issue with routing was that the routing system could not be based on a
absolute URL system. The absolute URL system would work best for a site, but not
for a app due to the difference in the file systems. The solution to that was to
implement a hash/push state routing system, which would allow the URLs to work
not only on a hosted website, but also the app itself.</p>

<p>Another problem I encountered that was absolutely terrifying to deal with was
external links vs internal links within the app/mobie-site. After hours of
querying Google for decent solutions to the problem, I barely found a solution.
The solution to the problem was to use Cordova&rsquo;s InAppBrowser
(which was not inherently clear&mdash;hence the hours of Google search) plugin&rsquo;s <code>window.open('http://url.com', '_system', 'location=no');</code>
which only works for iOS and a few other devices. Android was able to utilize <code>window.location = 'http://url.com';</code>.</p>

<p>Part of the reason this was a difficult problem was because that Cordova used
the WebViews that the different devices supplied. The WebViews could be best
described as web-browsers without the browsing (hence cross-compatibility via
HTML and JavaScript).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Overall Cordova was fairly fun to work with. No framework is without its quirks
and there will be many more obstacles for me in the future. The whole experience
really was exciting and I would recommend this framework to other developers.
Here&rsquo;s looking forward to future app development with Cordova!</p>

<h2>Why not Wordpress?</h2>

<p>I decided to use Octopress and Git as my source of blogging software because, as
a developer I need not concern myself with the style or hassle of making a style
for my own personal blog. I want my blog to focus on personal questions,
stories, and you guessed it&mdash;code!</p>

<p>Another benefit to a software such as Git and Octopress, I don&rsquo;t need to sit
around and find decent syntax highlighting tools. I can just simple put my code
into here.</p>

<h2>Intentions</h2>

<p>I do not expect many people to visit my blog, and I also do not care if many
people do. I am using this blog as a means to get out questions, observations,
documentation, and code.</p>
